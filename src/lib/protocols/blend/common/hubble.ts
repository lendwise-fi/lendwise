 * environment: it returns the full historical set, unbounded by the RPC's
 * ~7-day event retention. It also surfaces superseded redeployments still in
 * `status: Setup` — those are filtered downstream by the per-pool
 * `status === 6` guard in the enumerators.
 *
 * The query is parameterized on `@factory_ids` — the factory addresses are
 * never string-interpolated. Pool ids come back as UPPERCASE strkey already;
 * `.toUpperCase()` is a cheap guard. Output is deduped and sorted per
 * deployment label (the keys of `factories`).
