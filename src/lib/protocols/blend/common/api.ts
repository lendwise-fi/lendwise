/**
 * Minimum gap between two Soroban RPC calls, in ms.
 *
 * Pacing, not retrying, is what keeps us under a rate limit: a 429 has already
 * spent the request. And the ceiling is a RATE, not a volume — the two entry
 * points prove it, measured 2026-08-06 with both versions in parallel:
 *
 *   getApySpot    80 requests, peak  9/s — never refused in production
 *   getProducts   32 requests, peak 11/s — refused every single run
 *
 * The heavier path by call count is the one that passes. So the endpoint's real
 * ceiling sits between 9 and 11 req/s, not the 15 this was first calibrated
 * for. Blend products were absent from the catalogue for hours because of it,
 * and every collector slot in between discarded its 78 Blend snapshots.
 *
 * This interval does NOT translate into a rate one-for-one: the SDK fires
 * several requests inside a single wrapped `load()` and those are not spaced
 * against each other, so the burst survives a small increase. Measured on the
 * products path, both versions in parallel:
 *
 *   80 ms → peak 11/s, 4.1s      150 ms → peak 9/s, 4.3s
 *  300 ms → peak  7/s, 6.2s      600 ms → peak 5/s, 11.6s
 *
 * Hence 300, not the 12.5/s that 80 ms nominally caps at: it is the first value
 * that buys real margin under the rate the spot path sustains, and it costs the
 * enumeration two seconds.
 *
 * `STELLAR_RPC_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` overrides it — raise it for a stricter endpoint
 * (the free public one needs far more and will 429 regardless), lower it on a
 * faster plan to shorten the run. Verify against the measured PEAK rate, never
 * against the total or the nominal cap.

 * answer: that oracle carries no feed for the asset, today and on every retry.
 *
 * Everything downstream hangs off this line. A refusal must surface as a thrown
 * error so the route returns 500 and QStash re-runs the job; only a real

 * to parse it — so the whole set fits in one.

 * hands each its own XDR namespace, and blend's `decodeEntryKey` — which

 * it to a caret and this silently breaks at runtime. More generally, never hand

 * matched to their asset by contract address, not by position — the RPC does
