/**
 * Each entry is owned by its adapter (`{protocol}/{version}/presentation.ts`)
 * and spread in here — same explicit registration as `protocols-meta.ts` (no
 * filesystem discovery, see `src/lib/protocols/README.md`).
 *
 * Unlike that registry, this one is NOT client-safe: a hook may reach into its
 * adapter's utils (`getNetworkName`, `SLUG_MAPPING`). Its only consumer,
 * `src/lib/products/from-catalogue.ts`, runs on the server.
 *
 * Keyed by adapter id (`blend_v1`), not by provider (`blend`): the key is typed
 * by `ProtocolName`, and two versions of one protocol can present differently.
 * The flip side is that each version must register — v2 does not inherit v1's
 * fragment. `__tests__/protocols-presentation.test.ts` locks that down.
 *
 * `Partial` on purpose: a protocol that needs no override registers nothing and
 * gets the defaults in `core/presentation.ts`.
