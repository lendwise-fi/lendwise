/**
 * What each registered protocol overrides. Every hook it does NOT name falls
 * back to `core/presentation.ts` — that is a decision, so it is written down
 * here rather than inferred.
 *
 * This table is the point of the file. `PROTOCOLS_PRESENTATION` is keyed by
 * adapter id, not by provider, so two versions of one protocol register
 * separately: Blend v2 does not inherit v1's fragment. Dropping a registration
 * would otherwise be silent — the rows would simply fall back to `assetName`,
 * which is exactly the bug Blend v1 shipped once (five Stellar pools, same
 * asset, four rows reading identically).
 *
 * Adding a protocol fails this test until its presentation is decided, even if
 * the decision is "nothing to override" — an empty array.
